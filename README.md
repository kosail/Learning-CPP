# Learning C++ 😺

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Learning C++ repo where I'm diving into the world of C++ algorithms and competitive programming. The idea behind this is to deep understand how algorithms (and graph theory) is used around computer science. It's my try to get closer into the "logic" of computers, and the hardware side.

## 📘 Description
This repository aims to provide an educational environment where I can work on projects related to C++, from the basics to more advanced concepts. The structure of the repository is quite simple: all projects will be inside a folder categorizing them (eg. SortAlgorithms/SelectionSort/main.cpp). The projects may or may not have CMakeList depending on how complicated (or simple) they are. I like to keep things organized, but also straightforward.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute?
Learning is a collaborative journey, so I welcome contributions from fellow enthusiasts! Whether you want to fix a bug, optimize an algorithm, or add your own solutions to the mix, contributions are always appreciated. Simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## 📚 Learning Resources I'm Currently Using

## 📌 Note
This repository is primarily a place for learning and experimentation, not a heavy-duty development project or with grand ambitions.
